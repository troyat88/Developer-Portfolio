# Developer-Portfolio
To put my newly acquired HTML and CSS coding skills to practice, I created a portfolio. This website is where the projects that I complete throughout my coding bootcamp journey will live. 

## Link to Deployed Website:
https://troyat88.github.io/Developer-Portfolio/#contact-info

## Required Features: 
About Me, Projects and Contact 
Navigation Bar with links to corresponding sections
Hover effect on images in “Projects” section
Images in “Projects” section function as links to deployed projects 
Site is responsive to changes in screen size 

## Notes: 
The links to projects will take you to my Github page, since I have not deployed any of the major projects
I cannot get the site to display correctly on mobile. Something I will be working to fix and solidify as a coding skill
